# ClearTag

How to Use: Pressing the Secondary Button on your Left Controller will clear your status as tagger as well as others.

Note: If you download either of the ClearTag+Retag then pressing the Primary Button on your Left Controller will tag someone in your lobby according to the gamemode(or tag someone as if it's the tag gamemode and not infection).
Note: Someone joining the Lobby Will Update the Game and Start a new Round
